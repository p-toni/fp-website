## Chronological Flow
1. Initial Goal → Cheaper Space Travel
2. First Problem → Why are rockets so expensive?
3. Analysis → Materials cost vs. price disparity (2% vs 100%)
4. Root Cause → Single-use nature + inefficient industry practices
5. Solution → Reusability + vertical integration

## Context
- Space industry dominated by government contractors
- Rockets treated as single-use items since 1960s
- Launch costs prohibitively expensive ($65M+ per launch)
- Most innovation focused on payload capacity, not cost

## Market Assumptions Challenged
- Rockets must be expendable
- High costs are inherent to space technology
- Only governments can innovate in space
- Legacy components are most reliable
- Extensive outsourcing is efficient

## First Principles Breakdown
1. Physical/Technical Facts
   - Rocket materials: aluminum alloys, titanium, copper, carbon fiber
   - Raw materials cost ~2% of rocket price
   - Launch requires escaping Earth's gravity
   - Reentry creates extreme thermal/structural stress

2. Economic Facts
   - Materials cost/market price ratio extremely low (2%)
   - Fuel cost only 0.3% of launch price
   - Government cost-plus contracts encourage inefficiency
   - Multiple subcontractor layers add overhead

3. Process Analysis
   - Traditional manufacturing wastes 90-95% of raw materials
   - Legacy components from 1960s still in use
   - 4-5 layers of subcontractors typical
   - Each layer adds profit margin

## Solution Development
1. Initial Hypothesis
   - Vertical integration to reduce overhead
   - Modern manufacturing techniques (stir welding)
   - Design for reusability from start
   - In-house component development

2. Experimental Validation
   - Grasshopper Project for vertical landing
   - Iterative design improvements
   - Dragon capsule development
   - Multiple test flights

3. Implementation Challenges
   - New welding techniques for high-pressure vessels
   - Landing guidance systems
   - Reentry thermal protection
   - Recovery systems

## Results
- Launch cost reduced by factor of 10
- Material efficiency improved to 90%
- Successful rocket recovery and reuse
- New market opportunities enabled
