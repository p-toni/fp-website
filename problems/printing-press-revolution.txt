## Chronological Flow
1. Initial Goal → Faster Text Reproduction
2. First Problem → Why is writing inherently manual?
3. Analysis → Breaking down writing into physical components (shape transfer + pigment)
4. Root Cause → Lack of systematic replication method + inefficient ink transfer
5. Solution → Movable type + oil-based ink + mechanical pressure

## Context
- Text reproduction monopolized by monastic scribes
- Single Bible required 3 years to copy
- Books cost equivalent of average worker's 3-year salary
- Limited literacy due to text scarcity
- Knowledge transfer bottlenecked by copying speed

## Market Assumptions Challenged
- Text must be manually written
- Quality requires skilled calligraphy
- Each copy must be produced individually
- High costs are inherent to book production
- Scarcity of books is natural

## First Principles Breakdown
1. Physical/Technical Facts
   - Letters are shapes that transfer pigment
   - Metal can be cast into precise, durable shapes
   - Pressure can transfer ink uniformly
   - Oil-based ink adheres better than water-based
   - Mirror images create correct impressions

2. Material Properties
   - Lead/tin/antimony alloy optimal for type
   - Paper accepts ink better than vellum
   - Oil ink doesn't bleed like water-based ink
   - Metal type withstands repeated pressure
   - Different metals have different melting points

3. Process Analysis
   - Traditional copying wastes 95% of labor time
   - Letter shapes are finite and reusable
   - Consistent pressure produces uniform impression
   - Type can be rearranged infinitely
   - Mass production requires standardization

## Solution Development
1. Initial Hypothesis
   - Create reusable letter molds
   - Develop stable metal alloy
   - Design mechanical pressure system
   - Formulate new ink composition

2. Technical Innovations
   - Hand mold for consistent type casting
   - Lead-tin-antimony alloy (optimal hardness)
   - Modified wine press mechanism
   - Oil-based ink formula

3. Implementation Challenges
   - Achieving uniform type height
   - Preventing metal oxidation
   - Maintaining ink consistency
   - Creating precise alignment system

## Results
- Production time reduced from 3 years to 3 months per Bible
- Cost reduced by approximately 97%
- 20 million books printed in Europe by 1500
- Book price dropped from 3 years' to 3 months' wages
- Single press could produce 3,600 pages per workday
- Type pieces could be reused thousands of times
- Created foundation for information revolution
