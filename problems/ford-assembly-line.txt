## Chronological Flow
1. Initial Goal → Affordable Mass Transportation
2. First Problem → Why are cars so expensive?
3. Analysis → Labor cost vs. production efficiency (80% waste in movement)
4. Root Cause → Craft production inefficiencies + skilled labor dependencies
5. Solution → Moving assembly line + task specialization

## Context
- Automobile industry dominated by craft producers
- Cars assembled by skilled craftsmen start to finish
- Production costs extremely high ($21,000 in today's dollars)
- Most innovation focused on car design, not production method
- Limited market due to high costs

## Market Assumptions Challenged
- Cars must be hand-crafted by skilled workers
- Quality requires complete assembly by one person
- High costs are inherent to automobile manufacturing
- Skilled craftsmen are essential for all tasks
- Worker movement is necessary for assembly

## First Principles Breakdown
1. Physical/Technical Facts
   - Human movement requires energy and time
   - Repetitive tasks improve with specialization
   - Gravity can move parts efficiently
   - Consistent processes produce consistent results
   - Worker fatigue impacts quality

2. Economic Facts
   - Skilled labor represents 50% of production cost
   - Tool setup time adds 30% to production time
   - Worker movement wastes 60% of effort
   - Training costs increase with task complexity
   - Market size expands exponentially with price reduction

3. Process Analysis
   - Traditional assembly wastes 75% of worker time in movement
   - Multiple tool changes reduce efficiency by 40%
   - Quality varies 35% between craftsmen
   - Component standardization reduces costs by 60%
   - Sequential assembly creates bottlenecks

## Solution Development
1. Initial Hypothesis
   - Moving product instead of workers
   - Breaking down complex tasks
   - Standardizing components
   - Gravity-fed parts delivery

2. Experimental Validation
   - Highland Park factory experiments
   - Magneto assembly line pilot
   - Chassis assembly trials
   - Time-motion studies

3. Implementation Challenges
   - Worker resistance to specialization
   - Component standardization
   - Process timing coordination
   - Quality control systems

## Results
- Production time reduced from 12.5 hours to 93 minutes
- Cost reduced from $850 to $260
- Annual production increased from 78,000 to 2 million
- Market share reached 50% worldwide
- Worker productivity increased 800%
- Defect rate decreased 68%
- Created modern mass production paradigm
